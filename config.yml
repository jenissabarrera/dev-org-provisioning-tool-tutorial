- title: Introduction
  content: |
    This tutorial walks through the steps on how to implement BYOC Cloud in Genesys Cloud using [Purecloud Platform API](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/rest/client-libraries/index.html). In order for BYOC Cloud to work with a third-party carrier, the carrier must:
    
    * Be SIP-compliant
    * Support the UDP or TCP trunk transport protocol
    * Have a publicly routable IP address or host name
      * Carriers must fully support Record-Routing as required by RFC 3261 to ensure proper routing of sequential SIP requests.
    
    For more information about carrier requirements, check Genesys Resource Center article [Carrier requirements for BYOC Cloud](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/carrier-requirements-byoc-cloud/) 
    
    To test the code in the tutorial, A JSON file is needed to provide the required inputs needed to run the program. In this tutorial the JSON file is titled input-template.json.

- title: JSON Files and Variables
  content: |
    This file is used as substitute to input text box. This is where the user will enter all the necessary details. Key value pair has its corresponding description. Please make sure to fill all the required fields to proceed. 
    
    Please refer to [BYOC Cloud public SIP IP addresses](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/byoc-cloud-public-sip-ip-addresses/) for instance or Public SIP Addresses.

    ```{"language":"json"}
    {
      "client_id":"", // [Required] Genesys Cloud client id
      "client_secret":"", // [Required] Genesys Cloud client secret
      "location": {
          "name":"", // [Required] Assign any location name
          "number":"", // [Required] Please make sure to follow the number format E.164 e.g: +12345678911
          "street1":"", // [Required] 
          "city":"", // [Required] 
          "state":"", 
          "zipcode":"", // [Required] 
          "country":"", // [Required] Alpha-2 code format
          "countryFullName":"" // [Required] 
      },
      "site": {
          "name":"", // [Required] Assign any site name
          "timeZone":"" // [Required] ex: America/New_York
      
      },     
      "SipTrunk": {
          "ExternalTrunkName" :"", // [Required] User's chosen trunk name.
          "SipServers":"", // [Required] The Sip Servers or Termination URI is unique within user's Genesys Cloud Organization's region. The termination URI will be used by the 3rd party PBX or Carrier to direct SIP traffic to Genesys Cloud.
          "Realm":"", // Realm must match the username and password to be sent.
          "Password":"", // Password to send when trunk is challenged for the realm.
          "Address":"", // [Required] Specific overriding caller ID adddress to use as the outgoing origination address. May be a URI or raw phone number.
          "CallingName":"", // Specific overriding caller ID name to use as the outgoing origination address. May be a URI or raw phone number.
          "UserName":"", // User name to send when trunk is challenged for the realm.
          "instance": [] // [Required] BYOC Cloud public SIP IP addresses
      }
    }
    ```   

- title: Authentication
  content: |
    Genesys Cloud will verify user's credentials using Client Credential authentication. Once the validation is successful, it will proceed with the succeeding process.

- title: Check BYOC Feature
  content: |
    Get the list of products available for the org used, and check if the org has BYOC Capability. Please take note that only BYOC enabled orgs can proceed.

- title: Create Location
  content: |
    Create a Location in Genesys Cloud and save the return location data in a global variable.

- title: Create Site
  content: |
    To Create a new Site Two information is needed, one is the Location information and second is a Default Edge Group. The Location data is already saved to a variable. Now for the Edge Group. In PureCloud Admin > Telephony > Edge Groups, a default Edge Group should be available. Get the default Edge Group information and find "PureCloud Voice â€“ AWS".

- title: Create Trunk
  content: |
    Create a trunk base setting object base from the user input credentials from the JSON file.

- title: Set Outbound Route
  content: |
    Lastly, get the Outbound Route created by default when the Site was created, then update the External Trunk value with the previously created trunk.
